# Comment on "COMMON_FLAGS".
# For the "COMMON-FLAGS" option, regardless of the Intel or AMD CPU, 
# and regardless of the new or old CPU architecture, 
# it is recommended to use the "-march=native" option. 
# The CPU instruction set is automatically recognized comprehensively. 
# Programmers' users should be aware that 
# the "-fomit-frame-pointer" option will prevent the compiled program 
# from being debugged; 
# regular users who do not engage in program development or debugging 
# can confidently start it.

# NOTE: If your memory is large enough (8GB, 16GB), it is recommended 
# that you set the directory where temporary intermediate files are stored 
# during program compilation to the tmpfs (/tmp directory) of the memory 
# to reduce a large amount of reading and writing to the hard disk 
# during compilation, extend the lifespan of the hard disk,
