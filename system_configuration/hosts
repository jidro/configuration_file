# Host Database
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10	    x.acme.com	            # x client host
# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1            	localhost
##
127.0.0.1			    localhost
127.0.1.1			    localhost.localdomain	        localhost

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
