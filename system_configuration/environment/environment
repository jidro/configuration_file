# Environment variable
# An environment variable is a named object that contains data 
# that can be used by one or more applications. 
# Simply put, it is a variable with a pair of names and values. 
# The value of an environment variable can be the location 
# of all executables on the file system, the default editor, 
# system localization settings, and so on. 
# New Linux users may find this approach 
# to variable management a bit confusing. 
# But environment variables provide an easy way 
# to share configuration across multiple programs and processes.

## Fcitx5 configuration.

# Here is the configuration associated with Fcitx5.
# With this configuration, 
# the Fcitx5 input method is ready for normal use.

# Since then, the configuration has been commented out 
# as a part of the configuration. 
# Previously, 
# the configuration used after this line was not the configuration 
# before this line. 
# After testing, we found that many software can not be used, 
# so I changed it to the configuration before this line, 
# and it worked fine, 
# but the configuration after this line is the one mentioned in ArchWiKi, 
# and I don't know why it didn't pass the test, 
# so I left it here, 
# as a memento of it as is.

## The base directory where user-specific data files should be stored.
#
# XDG_DATA_DIR is an environment variable 
# that specifies a user-specific data file store directory path. 
# It is defined according to the XDG standard, 
# a specification for defining application behavior 
# on Linux and Unix systems. 
# According to the XDG specification, 
# on Linux and Unix systems, 
# different types of applications need to store their configuration files, 
# cache data, and other types of data in different directories. 
# Where the XDG_DATA_DIR variable is used to specify the main directory 
# path where an application can write its user data, 
# such as documents, music, pictures, and so on.
XDG_DATA_DIRS='/usr/local/share:/usr/share:/usr/share/gdm:/var/lib/menu-xdg:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/:/usr/share/gdm/:/var/lib/menu-xdg/:$HOME/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share:/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share'

## Qt Accessibility configuration
#
# The QT Accessibility module is designed 
# to help developers easily support Accessibility requirements, 
# making the applications they develop more accessible 
# to the disabled and the elderly. 
# Specifically, 
# the module provides apis that control properties such as widget size, 
# color, keyboard focus, and information 
# that can be used by screen readers and other assistive technologies. 
# When the user's operating system 
# and desktop environment support Accessibility, 
# the QT Accessibility module 
# will automatically interact with these features, 
# ensuring that developer-created applications can integrate with 
# various assistive technologies.
